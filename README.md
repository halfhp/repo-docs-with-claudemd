# Overview
This repo is an exploration of how a repo README.md and a CLAUDE.md can live together and share common sections while keeping things dry and minimizing the need to update multiple files when new shared content is created.
Another goal is to keep the addition of context to the LLM as small as possible.

The approach demonstrated here is to maintain common sections in CLAUDE.md and then link to them from README.md ensuring that only information that is explicitly meant for Claude is included as context.
